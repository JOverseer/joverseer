1. Bump the version in
main/resources/ctx/jideApplicationContext.xml
XPath:
 //beans/bean[@id='applicationDescriptor']/property[@name='version']
   @value='1.x.x'

 //beans/bean[@id='applicationDescriptor']/property[@name='buildId']
   @value='2014-x-x'

2. update the version in the changelog.txt

3. compile
  from eclipse by clicking on each component's build.xml in dependency order;
  txt2xmljar
  orderchecker
  joverseerupdaterjar
  joverseerjar
  
  and pick the appropriate target in
  joverseerRelease (build.xml)
  
4. or run buildjars.bat

5. ftp latestupdate.zip to middleearthgames.com

6. edit and update feed.xml

(delete the registry entry if testing)

(make sure update/update.jar is present)

start joverseer.

build the windows installer
 from jOverseerRelease\build.xml
using the target windowsInstaller
upload joverseer-setupxxxxx.exe to website

build the macOS installer
 from jOverseerRelease\build.xml
using the target MacOSInstaller
(requires a MacOS computer)
upload the *.pkg file to website

upload zip file for linux users?

update the website and wiki pages.

Remember that the updaters will not trigger until the feed.xml has a higher version number, so do that last.

Checklist of types of users
---------------------------
1. new Windows users
	a) using .exe installer
	b) using .zip 
2. new MacOS users
	a) using .pkg installer
	b) using .zip
3. new Linux users
	using .zip
4. updating windows users
5. updating MacOS users
6. updating Linux users
7. Beta channel users

Beta
----
The betachannel is similar, but uses betafeed.xml and latestbetaupdate.zip

MacOS packaging notes
=====================
At the moment a Mac is required to create the pkg.
Install 'Packages' from http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html
We also use 
https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub
to launch a java program on MacOS without worrying about which JVM is used.
The Java VM options are set in Info.plist (an xml file)
The jOverseer.icns file is one I created from public domain clipart from openclipart.org, and  I place it in the public domain too.
The installer installs using admin permissions in /Applications
The logfiles appear as $TMPDIR/joverseer* so check there for problems.
run 'Packages' on jOverseer.pkgproj to work out how to lay out the files as input.
build the package from within 'Packages' and upload the 17MB installer file.
When the subsequent installer pkg is run, macos may complain about it being from the internet.
Either control-left click the pkg file and say I trust it, or remove the extended attributes from the file....lookup the xattr command (xattr -l and -d)
The installer gives you the option to install somewhere else...I have not tried it.

do windows builds, then copy jOverseerRelease and launch4j(to be removed from the process later) to a mac.
run ant MacOSInstaller
ftp joverseer

Note: make sure line endings on the mac files are unix style. Problems can stop the launcher to run with a 'no such file or directory' in the console log.

Autoupdate notes
================

version 1.0.12 has new updater technology.


spotting new versions
---------------------
The joverseer application checks the RSS feed for notification of a new release.
"http://www.middleearthgames.com/software/joverseer/feed.xml"
version 1.0.12 has this hard-wired.
Later versions use the preference
 updates.RSSFeed
 in 
 resources/ctx/preferences-context.xml

The official beta RSS Feed is
"http://www.middleearthgames.com/software/joverseer/betafeed.xml"

Version numbers are compared numerically.
The middle 0 was dropped after 1.0.12, the next version being 1.13.0.
At the same time, it was decided to use odd number versions as beta versions.
That way, the timing of beta and stable releases can be decoupled, and still be consistent numerically.

The checking done in the code:
com.jidesoft.spring.richclient.docking.JideApplicationLifecycleAdvisor class, method onWindowOpened().


update.jar
----------
The key thing about auto updating in general is that at some point you have to spawn and switch to a separate process, so you can change the original files.

The updater is packaged as a separate jar file: update.jar.
It takes one optional argument, the url of the zipfile to download.
Normally it is the contents of the first url found in the RSS feed.


The source files

com.middleearthgames.updater.UpdateChecker  - checks the rss feed and compares the version
com.middleearthgames.updater.IThreepartVersion - interface for comparing 2 versions.
com.middleearthgames.updater.Main_Gui - The crude UI for the standalone updater part.
com.middleearthgames.updater.UpdateInfo - lists the changelog contents, and a lot of the complications needed to get updates to work under windows.

so UpdateInfo.update()
spawns java -jar update/update.jar 'download url'
if on linux/unix/mac
and for windows runs
jOverseerUpdate.exe


jOverseerUpdater.exe is a packaged version of java -jar update ....
for windows and tagged to request admin privileges.

update.Main_Gui.java is a simple java AWT application.
moves it to the appropriate place
deletes the initial version of the unpacked files.
and executes any updateapp.jar to execute any version-specific updates beyond just files updates.
NB. the cancel button just exits...it doesn't stop the download or undo the overwrite of files.


How to test updating
====================
To avoid spamming incomplete releases on the beta or live channel use:
http://www.middleearthgames.com/software/joverseer/testfeed.xml
http://www.middleearthgames.com/software/joverseer/testupdate.zip
remember to remove the 'lastupdated' preference in joverseer to persuade jOverseer to actually check for updates.
HKEY_CURRRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\org\joverseer\ui /last/Version/Check/Date
MacOS: use 'Pref Setter'. Windows: use regedit.
