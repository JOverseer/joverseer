0=The <b>map</b> can be scrolled by 1) using the <b>scroll bars</b>, 2) using the <b>arrow keys</b>, 3) dragging the map</b>. 
1=All the <b>tabs</b> can be drag-n-dropped. Just press and hold the left mouse button on a tab, and you can move it to wherever you want. The outline will indicate what will happen after you release the mouse button.
2=<b>Drop a tab on another window's title bar</b> to tab-dock with that window.<br>Or <b>drop a tab on any divider</b> to insert between two windows.
3=Press <b>ESC</b> if you want to cancel while dragging. Or press <b>CTRL</b> to prevent it from docking.
4=You can change the order of tabs by dragging. Just <b>drag a tab horizontally</b> within the tab area.
5=<b>Double click</b> on the title bar of each window to toggle between floating and docked mode.
6=You can <b>personalize</b> the behavior of JOverseer via the <i>Window -> Preferences</i> window.
7=Always check your orders with <b>Order Checker</b> before submitting them.<br>To run Order Checker use the <i>Run OrderChecker</i> menu option.
8=We hope that JOverseer imports your turn results completely accurately. <br>But if you want to change or edit elements of your position, you can do so...<br>In Current Hex View, click on the <i>bendy arrows</i> by armies or population centres to edit them. <br>Or click on the <i>bendy arrow</i> by the <i>Hex info</i> to add a new element entirely. <br>You can also edit artifacts in the Artifact pane by clicking on the pencil icon on the right.
9=When entering orders in the <b>Order Editor</b> you can <b>drag and drop</b> information from other windows. For instance, you can drag and drop <b>holding control and hex numbers from the map</b>, <b>character</b> and <b>artifact</b> ids from the Current Hex View. No more typos when filling in orders!
10=You can <b>visualize army ranges on the map</b> from the Army menu. Use the <i>Show Army Range</i> menu option to visualize the range while taking into account enemy pops, and the <i>Show Army Range (Ignore Enemy Pops)</i> option to ignore enemy pops.
11=Use the <b>filters</b> on the top of the information tabs to filter the displayed information.
12=<b>Order Results</b>, the pane you never knew existed! <br>Found under <i>Tools/General</i>, it lists every imported character's order results for the entire game. <br>This has many potential uses. <br>For example, if you want to quickly find all starting character bonuses for you or your team, <br>just scroll to the top and type 'special' ability in the Text search box.
13=Use the <i>Clear Map Items</i> button (or menu option) to clear items from the map (such as highlighted hexes or army ranges).<br>That's the button with the three colored dots and a diagonal line over them.
14=The <i>Tools</i> menu contains various tools to highlight information on the map.
15=Use the <i>Tools -> Highlight Degrade Candidates</i> to highlight all known pop centers that are in danger of degrading (i.e. no fortifications and loyalty less than or equal to 16). Pops degrade when the loyalty goes below 15, but this may happen to pops with 16 loyalty due to random fluctuations or loss of friendly pop centers.
16=Use the <i>Tools -> Highlight Characters</i> to highlight hexes with characters that satisfy the criteria you specify.
17=When <b>visualizing</b> movement orders, movement that is assumed to be invalid is denoted with a <b>red</b> line, whereas valid movement is denoted with a <b>black</b> line.
18=You can visualize orders on the map.<br>To do this, you have to check the <b>Draw Orders</b> option on the Map Options tab, and also check the <b>Draw</b> option on the individual orders you wish to visualize.
19=You can restore the program's <b>original window layout</b> by using the <i>Window -> Restore Original Layout</i> menu option.
20=You can view the <b>climate</b> for the known hexes.<br>To do this, select the <i>Show Climate</i> option in the Map Options tab. The climate is shown only for hexes that contain friendly population centers, but you can use this information to deduce the climate for neighboring hexes.
21=You can find what a character has been up to throughout the game using the <b>Track Character</b> information tab.<br>Simply enter the character's name and click <i>Track</i>.
22=<b>Rumors</b> that are linked to a specific hex are shown on the map with a small red square at the bottom of the hex.
23=You can add <b>notes</b> to hexes using the <i>Hex Info -> Add/Edit Note</i> option. With this feature you can write your own notes. Check the <i>Persistent</i> option to make the note appear in subsequent turns - otherwise it will only appear in the turn you wrote it.
24=In the <i>Chars (adv)</i> tab, column <b>Dragon Potential</b> shows the character's total skill (including artifact bonuses).
25=JOverseer does its best to guess if an army if <b>fed</b> or if is a <b>cavalry</b>. However, you can set this explicitly using the <i>Toggle 'Fed' Property</i> and <i>Toggle 'Cavalry' Property</i> options in the <i>Army Menu</i>.
26=You can <b>visualize characters ranges on the map</b> from the Character or the Hex Info menu. The various commands include options to show regular movement, or movement using the various movement spells.
27=<b>enHI</b> (shorthand for equivalent to naked Heavy Infantry) is a value used to measure army fighting ability. JOverseer calculates this value for all armies (approximately), giving you an easy way to measure their strength. To turn this on go to <i>Preferences -> Display -> Current Hex View -> Show naked HI equivalents.
28=In the <i>Spellcasters</i> information tab, enter a comma-separated list of spell numbers in the text box to see all casters in your team who know these spells.
29=If you click and drag the <i>Notepad</i> tab, you can turn it into a floating pane, and move it to wherever you want. This lets you use it while looking at <i>Current Hex View.</i> (This works with any tab!)
30=You can view earlier turn results by selecting them from the <b>'Turn'</b> dropdown in the <i>Map Options</i> tab (bottom right). Just remember to change back to the current turn before writing your orders!
31=If you are playing in a game where you see the rest of your team's results, and don't want to accidentally type in orders for their characters, you can specify the nations you are running by going to <i>Advanced -> Nation Selection</i> and choosing your nations. This will mean that the orders for characters you do not control are greyed out in the current hex view. (Note that this will not affect your nation selection for sending orders.)
32=When you have written and saved a diplo, don't forget to send it!
You can do this either by clicking <i>'Submit Diplo'</i> on the <i>Diplomatic Message</i> pane, or via the <i>Game -> Send Diplo</i> menu.
33=If you are unsure whether a teammate is able to submit orders, or if we emailed to say we are missing orders from a player, you can submit <i>Shadow Orders</i> for another nation. Just write the orders as usual, then when it comes to sending them, make sure you tick the <b>'Submit as Shadow Orders'<b> box in the <i>Send Orders<i> pane. This is vital, as it means we know that they are not from the actual player, and if they submit orders of their own we can use them in preference.
34=Want to see where other nations' capitals are located? Then go to <i>Preferences -> Map</i>, and tick <i>'Show Nation Names'<i>. Any population centre that you have marked as being a capital will then display the owning nation name. This is particularly useful if you are new to a module, as it lets you see which nation starts where. Or for added flavour on your map, you can also tick <i>'Show PC names'</i>.
35=Don't like the colours used for nations on the map? Then change them! Go to <i>Advanced -> Edit Nation Details</i>. You also can save colour sets for use in other games.
36=If you want to switch quickly between results from previous turns, bring up the <i>Turn</i> dropdown menu in the <b>Map Options</b> pane (bottom right), then scroll up and down the turn numbers rather than clicking on them. Particularly helpful for tracking the movement of armies on the map.
37=Done something to the layout of JOverseer that you didn't mean to? Then <i>Preferences -> Restore Layout</i> is your friend! It will set everything back to the default layout.
38=In the <b>Current Hex View</b> pane, the <i>Hex Info<i> includes the last turn you saw any information about that hex. This can help with planning, especially in areas of the world that are not on your nation maps.
39=The basic panes contain everything you need to play the game. But have you explored all the other 'hidden' panes, available from the Tools menu? Use them to give your gameplay a boost!
40=Don't like the basic appearance of JOverseer? Then change it! There are dozens of customisation options in <b>Preferences</b>. Or you can switch between Light and Dark modes to completely change how it looks.
41=Once you have a created a combat simulation in the combat calculator, it is then saved and can be viewed and opened again <i>(right click -> open)</i> from the <b>'combats'</b> tab, found in <i>tools -> armies -> combats</i>. You can also access combats created on previous turns by rewinding the turn in the map options tab.
42=Want to quickly zoom in or out of the map? Just click on the map and use the ctrl key + your mouse wheel!
43=Finding the text too small to read? Then increase it in <i>Preferences -> Windows Display.</i>
44=The drop down menu <i>Map -> hex info turn report<i> tells you the last turn number you had information for a hex, which is good for checking whether you have ever scouted a section of map or not (You will probably want <i>Map ->clear map items</i> once you're done).
